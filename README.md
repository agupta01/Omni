# OMNI

#### Omni is a simple demonstration of supervised machine learning.

This is the situation: You are driving on a straight road near a cliff, when all of a sudden, a sharp curve appears. You are going too fast to brake, which means you have two options:\
y - swerve into a group of pedestrians on the sidewalk, killing them.\
n - keep going straight, sacrificing yourself.

Omni reads how the user responds to this situation when different groups of people are on the sidewalk across 20-30 different scenarios. They include any combination of:
  1. male infant
  2. female infant
  3. male teen
  4. female teen
  5. dog
  6. pregnant woman
  7. male adult
  8. female adult
  9. male senior citizen
  10. female senior citizen

Then, it is capable of predicting, with a high degree of accuracy, what the user will choose (to swerve or not to swerve) on subsequent scenarios.

Any and all suggestions/bugs are appreciated, and if you have any questions, feel free to email me at
